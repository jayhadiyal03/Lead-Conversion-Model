This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting the conversion of leads for X Education, a company selling online courses to industry professionals. The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score to each potential customer, helping the sales team prioritize high-potential leads, also known as "Hot Leads."

# Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature engineering.
2. Predictive Modeling: Logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of lead conversion.
3. Threshold-Based Lead Scoring: Leads categorized into "Cold", "Warm", and "Hot" based on a scoring threshold.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC for model performance evaluation.
5. Visualizations: Includes charts such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, lead category distribution, and feature importance.

# Results:
--> Achieved an accuracy of 93%, with a lead scoring model capable of improving the company's lead-to-sale conversion rate.
The model effectively prioritizes leads, helping the sales team focus on the most promising prospects.

# Files:
--> Jupyter Notebook: Contains the full analysis, model training, and evaluation.
